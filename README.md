**Friendly Reminder:**

There's certainly a more straightforward/sensible approach to this whole song and dance if we were to refactor the table to store `year` and `month` as an actual datetime:

That said, it's fair to recognize that the overhead of refactoring the rest of your app (within such a short sprint) makes this approach better for now. ðŸ™‚
